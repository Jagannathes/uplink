Design keeping this in mind

* Swappable collectors and serializers
* Control the behaviour of each thread based on incoming mqtt notifications
* Persistence with priority
* Graceful shutdown
* Disable and enable a channel at collector
* Sampling channel data
* System metrics like memory, cpu, network io etc
* Self Instrumentation..Incoming bandwidth, Outgoing bandwidth, Disk backlog etc
